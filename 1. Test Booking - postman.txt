In this exercise, the Postman tool was used to test the API. The exercise was performed in Resful-Booker, which allows testing the API testing tool.
Resful-Booker is a WebAPI interface for creating, updating, and deleting. It is equipped with authentication function. The API comes with 10 pre-loaded records to work with and resets back to the default state every 10 minutes.
Resful-Booker also includes detailed API documentation on the page: https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html

A collection named "Test Booking" was created.
The following was tested and verified:

1. Whether it is possible to obtain the identifiers of all bookings that exist in the API interface by making a request named "GetBookingIds". Additionally, a test was performed to check if the response code has a status of 200 and if the response time of the request is less than 1000 ms (despite the lack of information about recommended performance, attention was paid to the execution time of the request for verification purposes).
2. Whether the application returns a specific booking based on the provided booking identifier.
3. Whether it is possible to create a new booking in the API and also checking if the response code has a status of 200.
4. Whether it is possible to update a booking without authentication. A test called "Status code = 403?" was performed and a positive result was obtained.
5. Creating a new token for authentication purposes to access PUT and DELETE.
6. Creating an environment named "New Token" and specifying a variable for the acquired value, indicating the variable type as secret.
7. Checking if the previously created booking can be updated in the resource using the PUT method with the created environment variable for the token value.
